FAR - Find And Replace. FAR offers a programmatic API and a Swing GUI for find and replace operations
on file content accross multiple files in entire directory trees. FAR comes with support for operations
on multiple lines, automatic backup and various character encodings.
<p>
For the core API check out the {@link net.pandoragames.far base package}. If you are rather looking 
for the main class, go to {@link net.pandoragames.far.ui.swing.FindAndReplace FindAndReplace} in the 
{@link net.pandoragames.far.ui.swing Swing package}.
</p><p>
FAR has also a GUI oriented, but GUI neutral intermediate layer. Have a look to 
{@link net.pandoragames.far.ui.UIBean UIBean} and {@link net.pandoragames.far.ui.UIFace UIFace}
to see where other user interfaces may be docked.
