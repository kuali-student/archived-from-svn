<h1>Rename</h1>
Please note that you have to execute the FIND command first, i.e. you always
have to define the set of files to operate on <i>before</i> you may apply any renaming.
<p>
As for the replace command, you may exclude files from the list by unselecting the
respective checkbox in the result list. Files thus excluded will not be renamed.
</p><p>
Specify the part of the file names that should be replaced in the first textbox ("Find...").
All changes that would apply are immediately displayed in the right column of the file list. 
This gives you the best controle over what will happen when you press the 
"Rename" button. Please note that <b>no changes will be made until 
you press the "Rename" button</b>.
</p><p>
You may use <i>regular expressions</i> or the <i>simple pattern</i> that is used for
the file names on the "Find" tab. See the description of the 
<a href="manual01-find.html">Find</a> command for details about <i>simple patterns</i>. 
Select or unselect the "Regular Expression" checkbox accordingly.<br>
You can also specify whether the expression shall be case sensitive or not. This
applies to both, regular expressions and simple patterns.
</p><p>
By default <b>FAR protects the file extension</b> from changes since this may render
the file unreadable for other applications. You may however decide to include 
the file extension (i.e. to lift the protection), or even to apply changes to the 
file extension <b>only</b>. Select the last radio button if you want to change 
nothing but the file extension.
</p><p>
The second text field takes the text you want to use as a replacement. If you have
been using regular expressions, you may now use a replacement pattern with 
<i>capturing groups</i>. See the <a href="regex.html">regular expressions</a> help for details.
</p><p>
You can also force file names to become all uppercase (or all lower case). Note that
this applies to all files in the list, whether they match the pattern in the 
"Find..." text field or not.
</p><p>
If the "Prevent Case Conflict" checkbox at the bottom of the page is selected,
FAR will not allow that different files get names that differ only in letter case.
On Windows this checkbox cannot be deselected.
</p><p>
The <b>Reset</b> button will reset the application to its initial state. In particular
will the result file list be cleared.
