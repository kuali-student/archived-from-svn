Feature: REG.Registration Holds

  CR 3.5 - As an administrator, I want the system to stop the studentâ€™s access
           to the term if there are active holds so that students cannot perform
           registration functions
  CR 3.6 - As a administrator, I want the system to prevent the student from performing
           registration transactions if there are holds on her record so that holds are
           not violated

  Background:
    Given I am using a mobile screen size

  #KSENROLL-15183
  Scenario: CR 3.5 - student is unable to access registration because of holds
    Given I log in to student registration as A.JAYR
    And I attempt to access registration for Fall 2012
    Then there is a message indicating that registration is unavailable for the term
    And there is a message indicating I have a mandatory advising hold

  #KSENROLL-15184
  Scenario: CR 3.6 - student is unable to register for a course because of holds
    Given I log in to student registration as A.JANED
    And I attempt to register for a course in Fall 2012
    Then there is a message indicating that I cannot register because I have too many registration transactions
