Feature: REG.Registration Holds

  CR 3.5 - As an administrator, I want the system to stop the studentâ€™s access
           to the term if there are active holds so that students cannot perform
           registration functions
  CR 3.6 - As a administrator, I want the system to prevent the student from performing
           registration transactions if there are holds on her record so that holds are
           not violated
