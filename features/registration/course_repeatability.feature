Feature: REG.Course Repeatability
  CR 18.1 - As an administrator, I want to prevent a student from registering for a course if they have
            previously attempted it so the student complies with university policy
  CR 18.2 - As as administrator, I want to prevent a student from registering for a course if they have
            previously attempted and received a specific mark
  CR 18.3 - As an administrator I want to warn a student when registering for a course if attempted previously
            so that they know this is the last allowed attempt
  CR 18.4 - As an administrator I want to exclude repeatable courses from the repeatability
            check so students can register for the course, repeatedly
  CR 18.9 - As an administrator I want to prevent students from registering for the same course multiple times
            in a term so that they donâ€™t consume more than one seat in a course
