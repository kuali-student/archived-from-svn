Feature: Create registration groups

As an Administrator, I want to create registration groups for a Course Offering

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as admin

  Scenario: RG 2.1A: Successfully create a activity offering cluster (for a course offering with a single activity offering type) and assign activity offerings to the cluster
    Given I manage registration groups for a course offering
    When I create an activity offering cluster
    And I assign an activity offering to the cluster
    Then the activity offering is shown as part of the cluster
    And the remaining activity offerings are shown as unassigned

  Scenario: RG 2.1B/2.4B: Successfully create a default activity offering cluster and reg groups?????? with all activity offerings assigned to the cluster
    Given I manage registration groups for a course offering
    When I generate registration groups with no activity offering cluster
    Then a default activity offering cluster is created
    And all activity offerings are assigned to the cluster
    And the registration groups are generated for the default cluster
    And there are no remaining unassigned activity offerings

  Scenario: RG 2.1C: Error message is displayed if I attempt to create 2 activity offering clusters with the same private name
    Given I manage registration groups for a course offering
    When I create an activity offering cluster
    And I try to create a second activity offering cluster with the same private name
    Then an error message appears stating "duplicate cluster name"
    And only one activity offering cluster is created

  Scenario: RG 2.2A: Attempt to generate registration groups where the Activity Offering Cluster does not contain at least one Activity Offering for each Activity Offering Type which is part of the Format Offering definition.
  #CHEM242
    Given I manage registration groups for a course offering with multiple activity types
    When I create an activity offering cluster
    And I assign 2 activity offerings of the same type to the cluster
    And I generate registration groups
    Then an error message appears stating "cluster must contain at least one activity from each of those associated with this Format"
    And no registration groups are generated

  Scenario: RG 2.2B - Cannot generate default (unconstrained) AOC unless there is at least one AO for each AO Type specified by the FO
  #CHEM347
    Given I manage registration groups for a course offering with multiple activity types but no activity offering for one of the activity types
    When I generate registration groups with no activity offering cluster
    Then an error message appears stating "cluster must contain at least one activity from each of those associated with this Format"
    And no activity offering cluster is created
    And no registration groups are generated

  Scenario: RG 2.3A: Generate registration groups where the max enrolment is not equal for activity types within the constrained activity offering cluster
  #CHEM317?
    Given I manage registration groups for a course offering with 2 activity types
    When I create an activity offering cluster
    And I assign two activity offerings of different types and different max enrolment
    And I generate registration groups
    Then a warning message appears stating "The sums of maximum enrollment seats for each activity offering type are not equal"
    And a registration group is generated

  Scenario: RG 2.3B - Generate registration groups where the max enrolment is not equal for activity types within the DEFAULT activity offering cluster
  #BIOL180
    Given I manage registration groups for a course offering with multiple activity types where the total max enrolment for each type is not equal
    When I generate registration groups with no activity offering cluster
    Then a warning message appears stating "The sums of maximum enrollment seats for each activity offering type are not equal"
    And the registration group is generated

  Scenario: RG 2.4A: Successfully generate registration groups for several constrained activity offering clusters with assigned activity offerings
  #CHEM317?
    Given I manage registration groups for a course offering with 2 activity types
    When I create 2 activity offering clusters
    And I assign 2 activity offerings to each cluster
    And I generate all registration groups
    Then registration groups are generated

#2.4B see above

  Scenario: RG 2.4C: Generate registration groups for several constrained activity offering clusters with assigned activity offerings with scheduling conflicts
  #CHEM455?
    Given I manage registration groups for a course offering with multiple activity types where there are activity offering scheduling conflicts
    When I create 2 activity offering clusters
    And I assign two activity offerings to each cluster with scheduling conflicts
    And I generate registration groups
    Then a warning message appears stating "there are scheduling conflicts"
    And registration groups are generated
    And registration groups with time conflicts are marked as invalid

  Scenario: RG 2.4D: Generate Reg Groups for default AO Cluster where there are scheduling time conflicts.
  #CHEM455?
    Given I manage registration groups for a course offering with multiple activity types where there are activity offering scheduling conflicts
    When I generate registration groups with no activity offering cluster
    Then a default activity offering cluster is created
    And all activity offerings are assigned to the cluster
    And the registration groups are generated for the default cluster
    And there are no remaining unassigned activity offerings
    And a warning message appears stating "there are scheduling conflicts"
    And registration group with time conflicts is marked as invalid

  #Scenario: RG 2.4c/d alternative - reg groups already generated (default/constrained), assign an activity offering that to groups that causes scheduling conflicts

  Scenario: RG 3.1A: assign one or more AOs to an existing constrained AOC and update the Reg Groups for this FO
  #CHEM221?
    Given I have generated a registration group for a course offering with lecture and quiz activity types leaving some activity offerings unassigned
    And I manage registration groups for the course offering
    When I assign a quiz activity offering to the existing activity offering cluster
    And I confirm a warning message appears stating "only some registration groups are generated"
    And I generate the registration group for that cluster
    Then additional registration groups are generated for the new quiz #reg group ids don't change
    And the quiz is not listed as an unassigned activity offering

  Scenario: RG 3.1B: assign one or more AOs to an existing default AOC and update the Reg Groups for this FO
  #existing reg group ids don't change
    Given I have created the default registration group for a course offering
    And I add 2 activity offerings to the course offering
    When I manage registration groups for the course offering
    And I confirm that the 2 activity offerings are listed as unassigned
    And I confirm a warning message appears stating "only some registration groups are generated"
    And I assign the new activity offerings to the default activity offering cluster
    And I generate the registration group for that cluster
    Then additional registration groups are generated for the 2 new activity offerings
    And the 2 new activity offerings are not listed as an unassigned activity offerings

    #what is the difference between RG 3.1A and 3.1C -- 3.1C is specifically the delta test
  Scenario: RG 3.1C: assign an AO to an AOC with RGs and generate only the new RG for that new AO, leaving the existing RGs unchanged

    When I move a quiz activity offering from the first activity offering cluster to the second activity offering cluster
    And I confirm a warning message appears stating "only some registration groups are generated"
    And I generate all registration groups
    Then the registration groups sets are updated
#10. The AO is no longer shown in group2 but does show in group1. Group1 status now reads "Only Some RG generated" ---check this
